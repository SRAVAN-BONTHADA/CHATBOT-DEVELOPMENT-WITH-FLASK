   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up your Hugging Face API key:**
   - Obtain your API key from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
   - Add it to the Flask app (`app.py`) as an environment variable or directly in the code:
     ```python
     HF_API_KEY = "your_huggingface_api_key"
     ```

5. **Run the Flask application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
